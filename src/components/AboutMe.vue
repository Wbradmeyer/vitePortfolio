        <p>
            I am a full-stack developer and a music educator. I enjoy problem-solving and breaking down 
            information into manageable parts to benefit others and myself. I believe life-long learning 
            is essential to working a job and for living a rewarding life in general. Most recently I have 
            been learning the Django web framework as well as bass guitar. As a 17-year educator, I have a 
            wealth of experience in planning, collaborating with others, and mentoring.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am proficient in Python (Flask and Django), Java (Spring Boot), and JavaScript (React) and have 
            two music degrees. I really enjoy both disciplines as they blend together problem-solving, creativity, 
            logic, and syntax. Whether working with front-end or back-end, or writing or rehearsing a song, the 
            build is fun. Both coding and music have allowed me to meet and work with some unique, amazing, 
            inspiring people.
