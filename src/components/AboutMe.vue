    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p class="about">
        I am a full-stack developer and a music educator. I enjoy problem-solving and breaking down 
        information into manageable parts to benefit others and myself. I believe life-long learning 
        is essential to working a job and for living a rewarding life in general. Most recently I have 
        been learning the Django web framework as well as bass guitar. As a 17-year educator, I have a 
        wealth of experience in planning, collaborating with others, and mentoring.

        I am proficient in Python (Flask and Django), Java (Spring Boot), and JavaScript (React) and have 
        two music degrees. I really enjoy both disciplines as they blend together problem-solving, creativity, 
        logic, and syntax. Whether working with front-end or back-end, or writing or rehearsing a song, the 
        build is fun. Both coding and music have allowed me to meet and work with some unique, amazing, 
        inspiring people.
